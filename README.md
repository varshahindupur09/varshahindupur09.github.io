Varsha Hindupur's GitHub Overview
Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you will find a collection of my projects and contributions in the fields of data science, machine learning, and generative AI. My repository includes various projects showcasing my skills and interests. Below is a brief overview of some of the key projects:

Featured Projects
1. RAG Chatbot: MovieMania
This project demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. The chatbot assists users in making personalized movie recommendations, narrowing down choices to provide tailored suggestions. Check out the project here.

2. Brand Diversity Analysis
Developed a system that evaluates publicly available data to analyze and recommend the diversity level of brands. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and extensive data collection and evaluation methods.

3. Cancer Prediction using HPC
Built a High-Performance Computing (HPC) model for predicting cancers. This model is parallelized and can effectively identify cancerous data from various images, demonstrating advanced machine learning and computational skills.

4. Generative AI Chatbot for Restaurant Assistance
Utilized LLM, Langchain, and RAG to create a chatbot designed to assist customers with questions about food and services at an Indian restaurant. This project highlights my ability to combine generative AI techniques for practical applications.
